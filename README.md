# Customer-Segmentation-using-ML

I have used the Customer segmentation dataset from KAGGLE 

On the basis of their income,spending score and age i have applied k-means clustering algorithm on them.. and divided
the group of customers into clusters. Each cluster represents a different group and a different choice of buying products.
This is very useful for a business that isn't grown much yet and wants to analyze the majority of the type of customers(in terms of age, annual income,
type of products they buy the most) coming to their shop.
Moreover with this clustering it is even possible to know the relationship between dependent and independent variables.
